## A Mini Vehicle Tracking Dashboard.

#### Developed a vehicle tracking dashboard, leveraging React.js, Node.js and MongoDB to efficiently store, manage, and seamlessly deliver real-time updates on vehicle movement and speed. I've ensured that the codebase is both easily comprehensible and well-documented.

Live Demo: https://vehicle0.vercel.app

### Features

#### Frontend:

- **Tools**: Utilized ReactJS, SASS, and JavaScript for the interface design with responsive.
- **Map**: Implemented a dynamic map displaying live vehicle markers along with vehicle details.
- **Filter**: Added filter functionality that conditionally shows vehicles based on certain conditions.
- **Graph**: Included a graph or chart that shows metrics like distance covered by each vehicle and their current speed

#### Backend:

- Established a Node.js application integrated with a MongoDB database to securely manage and persist vehicle-related data.

### Chalanges

- Map with custom icons and markers.
- Write conditions on both the frontend and backend for filter functionality.

### Errors

- Websocket: Can't update the live status of the vehicles.
